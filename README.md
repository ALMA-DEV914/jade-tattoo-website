## Description

A login and signup features where user can add reviews and join the conversations. It has a features of user profile where can only be access by login in or signing up. Users can also logout and you can add a friend in your list.

## Tools and Technologies

    REACT.JS - for client side or UI
    NODE.JS, EXPRESS.JS - for server side or backend, database management
    BCRYPT - for encryption
    APOLLO-SERVER-EXPRESS 
    GRAPHQL - set up a single API endpoint where we can retrieve as much or as little data as we need from multiple resources such as databases, microservices, or even other third-party APIs, all in a single HTTP request.
    MONGOOSE - Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
    JWT/JSONWEBTOKEN - is used for stateless authentication mechanisms for users and providers, this means maintaining session is on the client-side instead of storing sessions on the server
    FAKER - is a package that creates fake data for you
    APOLLO/CLIENT - is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.
